Aspiring Software Engineer | B.Tech Graduate – SASTRA University  
Skilled in Java, Python, AI, DevOps, and Cloud Technologies  
Open to IT Opportunities

## About Me

I’m a B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at SASTRA University, with a strong interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, algorithms, and systems thinking.

My technical exposure includes hands-on projects in image processing, IoT, computer vision, and autonomous navigation. I’ve developed:

• An Automated energy meter reading system using MATLAB and ThingSpeak for cloud integration and real-time monitoring,  
• An ASL (American Sign Language) detection model using CNN and OpenCV for assistive communication, and  
• Procedural Text Content Creation for Games using NLP by designing a generative AI system to create dynamic game narratives, dialogues and quests.

I’ve completed certifications including the "Deloitte Cyber Security Virtual Job Simulation", "Simplilearn Skill Up Front-End Web Development", and the "Microsoft Azure Fundamentals" learning path, enhancing my practical understanding of real-world business challenges and modern web technologies.

I’m currently seeking internship or entry-level opportunities in:

• Software or Embedded Development  
• AI/ML and Computer Vision  
• IoT and Cloud-based Applications

I’m committed to continuous learning, collaborative development, and building technology that has real-world impact.
